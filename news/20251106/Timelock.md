## HashKey Chain Mainnet Deploys New Project Timelock: Jointly Building the Next-Generation On-Chain Security Foundation

HashKey Chain recently announced that the decentralized execution security protection layer Timelock has been officially deployed on the HashKey Chain mainnet and is now fully open. As the preferred public blockchain for financial institutions and RWA asset tokenization, HashKey Chain ensures compliance and performance while continuously expanding its security infrastructure landscape through a well-developed developer ecosystem. Timelock introduces the governance and treasury security paradigm of “mandatory time buffer” into the mainnet production environment in the form of standardized components, providing auditable, reversible, and governable execution paths for core scenarios. The combination of the two will jointly enhance the security boundaries and governance transparency of on-chain finance, promoting the steady circulation and large-scale application of institutional assets on-chain.
<br></br>
In the current market environment, the synergy between security and compliance has become an industry consensus. HashKey Chain inherits the decentralized security of Ethereum and achieves low gas fees and high throughput through high-performance optimization, providing a stable and secure on-chain environment for traditional financial assets.
<br></br>
The core of Timelock lies in adding a mandatory time buffer to every critical on-chain operation, enabling all transactions to possess the execution characteristics of being auditable, upgradeable, and reversible. Each operation, once queued, must go through a minimum delay period and be executed within a grace period; if it is not executed within the time limit, it will automatically become invalid. By separating decision-making and execution into an observable time window, Timelock provides the community and security teams with sufficient time for review and response, allowing the default security of “time as defense” to be truly implemented. In the future, Timelock will become the new generation of security foundation on HashKey Chain, assisting institutions in meeting the requirements for security and stability, and further consolidating the compliant and friendly foundation of on-chain finance.
<br></br>
The official deployment not only marks the interoperability between Timelock and HashKey Chain at the technical level, but also signifies that security infrastructure is being systematically introduced into the ecological development of HashKey Chain.
<br></br>
 “On the path where compliance and innovation are equally important, security is the non-negotiable bottom line. The official deployment of Timelock on the HashKey Chain mainnet allows institutional users and developers to have a more complete security experience without sacrificing performance,” said Skylar, Head of HashKey Chain. “We will continue to work together with ecosystem partners to build security infrastructure for institutional-grade DeFi and RWA based on low cost, high performance, and open standards.”
<br></br>
The Timelock team stated that on-chain asset security and permission management have always been the core requirements in institutional finance and RWA asset circulation scenarios. Multi-signature and other single-point-of-failure avoidance mechanisms have been widely verified and applied, yet preemptive execution security mechanisms in the time dimension are equally crucial to the stable operation of the on-chain ecosystem. We are honored to have reached a cooperation with HashKey Chain, allowing Timelock to further explore standardized governance buffering, transparent auditing, and permission management paths within a compliant and friendly mainnet environment. We also feel a great sense of responsibility and look forward to continuously improving risk control capabilities in core scenarios such as asset management and protocol governance through temporal buffering and security window mechanisms, promoting the continuous expansion of the security boundaries of open finance.
<br></br>
HashKey Chain will continue to cooperate with leading global financial institutions and Web3 projects to build low-cost, high-performance, and highly reliable on-chain financial infrastructure around key scenarios such as institutional-grade DeFi, RWA, and stablecoins. With Timelock officially launched on the mainnet, we look forward to jointly creating a more secure, transparent, and sustainable open financial ecosystem together with developers, institutions, and the community

## HashKey Chain 主网部署新项目 Timelock：共同构建新一代链上安全底座 
HashKey Chain 近日宣布，去中心化执行安全防护层 Timelock 已于 HashKey Chain 主网完成正式部署并全面开放。作为金融机构与 RWA 资产上链的首选公链，HashKey Chain 在保障合规与性能的同时，以完善的开发生态持续扩展安全基础设施版图；而 Timelock 将“强制时间缓冲”的治理与金库安全范式，以标准化组件的形式引入主网生产环境，为核心场景提供可审计、可回滚、可治理的执行路径。二者的结合将共同提升链上金融的安全边界与治理透明度，推动机构级资产在链上的稳健流转与规模化应用。
<br></br>
在当下的市场环境中，安全与合规的协同已成为行业共识。HashKey Chain 继承以太坊的去中心化安全性，并通过高性能优化实现低 Gas 与高吞吐，为传统金融资产提供稳定、安全的链上环境。
<br></br>
Timelock 的核心在于为每一笔关键链上操作增加强制时间缓冲，使所有交易具备“可审计（auditable）、可升级（upgradeable）、可回滚（reversible）”的执行特性：每笔操作在进入队列后，必须经历最小延迟期（minimum delay），并在宽限期（grace period）内执行；若超期未执行则自动失效。通过将决策与执行分离到可观察的时间窗口，Timelock 赋予社区与安全团队充分的审查与响应时间，让“时间即防线”的默认安全真正落地。未来，Timelock 将在 HashKey Chain 上成为新一代安全底座，协助机构满足安全稳定的要求，进一步夯实合规友好的链上金融基础。
<br></br>
本次正式部署不仅标志着 Timelock 与 HashKey Chain 在技术层面的互通，也意味着安全基础设施正在被系统性引入到 HashKey Chain 的生态建设中。
“在合规与创新并重的路径上，安全是不可妥协的底线。Timelock 在 HashKey Chain 主网的正式部署，使得机构用户与开发者能够在不牺牲性能的前提下，进一步拥有完善的安全体验。”Head of HashKey Chain Skylar 表示，“我们将继续携手生态伙伴，以低成本、高性能与开放标准为底座，构建面向机构级 DeFi 与 RWA 的安全基础设施。”
<br></br>
Timelock 团队表示，链上资产安全与权限管理始终是机构级金融与 RWA 资产流转场景中的核心诉求。多重签名等单点故障规避机制已得到广泛验证与应用，然而时间维度下前置的执行安全机制对于链上生态的稳健运作同样至关重要。此次有幸与 HashKey Chain 达成合作，使 Timelock 得以在合规友好的主网环境中，进一步探索标准化治理缓冲、透明审计与权限管理路径。我们也深感责任重大，期待以时域缓冲 yu间窗口机制为资产管理、协议治理等核心场景持续提升风险防控能力，推动开放金融的安全边界不断拓展。
<br></br>
HashKey Chain 将持续与全球领先的金融机构与 Web3 项目合作，围绕机构级 DeFi、RWA 与稳定币等核心场景，构建低成本、高性能与高可靠的链上金融基础设施。随着 Timelock 正式登陆主网，我们期待与开发者、机构与社区共同打造更加安全、透明与可持续的开放金融生态。
