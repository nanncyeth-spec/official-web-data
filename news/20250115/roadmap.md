## Overview

As the Chinese proverb says: "Time flows constantly, and new chapters emerge daily." At the turn of the year, HashKey Chain officially releases its 2025 roadmap, showcasing its latest development plans to our supportive users, developers, communities, and ecosystem partners.

## Key Achievements

As a public blockchain that has been live on the mainnet for less than a month, HashKey Chain has already demonstrated a successful launch. We are deeply grateful for the trust and support of every user, community, and partner. In just a few months since the announcement of HashKey Chain, we've delivered impressive results:

- **Testnet achievements:** Over 25.8 million transactions, more than 870,000 wallet registrations, an average block time of 2 seconds, gas fees as low as 0.1 Gwei, the successful deployment of 50 projects, and engagement from 300,000 community members.
- **Mainnet progress:** Within one month of launch, 11 projects have been successfully deployed, with 980,000 transactions on-chain. Numerous media outlets and organizations have identified HashKey Chain as one of the Ethereum Layer 2 solutions with the most growth potential in 2025.

In November 2024, HashKey Chain's native token, $HSK, was listed on major exchanges, including HashKey Global, KuCoin, Gate.io, BingX, MEXC, and WOO X. Within the first month of its token generation event (TGE), HSK achieved a price increase of up to 270%.

## Our Vision: A Bridge Between Web2 and Web3

HashKey Chain aims to serve as a bridge between Web2 and Web3 by bringing Web2 assets into Web3, enriching the asset classes and use cases of Web3. At the same time, we seek to innovate how Web3 assets are issued and apply these innovations to Web2, unlocking the liquidity of traditional Web2 assets. Ultimately, we aim to create a seamlessly integrated world where Web2 and Web3 coexist and connect.

HashKey Chain focuses on BTCFi, PayFi, RWA, and stablecoins to build compliance-driven on-chain financial infrastructure to achieve this. This strategy highlights our competitive advantages and underscores HashKey Group's mission and determination as an industry pioneer.

## Key Highlights of the 2025 Roadmap

### Technical Breakthroughs: "Smart Escape Hatch" Security Mechanism and Multilayer DAO Governance

- **"Smart Escape Hatch" Security Mechanism:** While Layer 2 solutions have introduced unprecedented scalability to blockchain, they have also brought new security challenges. In 2025, HashKey Chain introduced the "Smart Escape Hatch" mechanism, a revolutionary security feature for Layer 2 ecosystems. This mechanism ensures the ultimate security of assets by periodically syncing state Merkle trees to Layer 1. If anomalies occur on the Layer 2 network or DeFi protocols, smart contracts automatically trigger a protective mechanism, enabling users to safely and quickly withdraw their assets back to the mainnet. This innovation eliminates the risk of "asset black holes" in Layer 2 ecosystems, providing unmatched asset security.

- **Multilayer DAO Governance:** HashKey Chain's governance framework is built on a carefully designed multilayer DAO structure. It incorporates a comprehensive risk mitigation and decision-making mechanism beyond a simple voting system. For instance:
    - The **Security Committee DAO** responds to potential threats swiftly.
    - The **Technical Audit DAO** focuses on in-depth analysis and verification. This structure balances professionalism and flexibility. Staking mechanisms and reputation systems create effective incentives, ensuring participants are rewarded proportionally to their contributions. Additionally, transparent dispute-resolution mechanisms foster trust across the ecosystem.
These mechanisms redefine Layer 2 security standards and governance models, making safety and decentralized governance integral to the protocol's architecture.

### Product Innovation: Launching the veHSK Liquid Staking Mechanism to Unlock the Value of HSK

As the market evolves and user demands change, traditional staking models have begun to reveal certain limitations. For instance, while these models often offer high annualized returns, they typically suffer from low liquidity and cannot leverage additional benefits from other on-chain DeFi protocols. This poses a significant challenge for users seeking higher returns and greater flexibility in liquidity.

To address this issue, HashKey Chain has enhanced its staking platform by introducing the innovative **veHSK (vote-escrow HSK)** mechanism. This transforms staking from a simple rewards model into a dynamic, expandable ecosystem that offers users more stable and diverse earning opportunities.

In HashKey Chain's staking system, veHSK is not merely a derivative of staking; it is a token generated by staking HSK and offers multiple use cases and significant advantages. By staking HSK to generate veHSK, users gain access to a range of additional benefits:

- **Higher Yields**

veHSK acts as an "upgraded version" of staking, enabling users to earn stable base rewards and additional returns by participating in DeFi applications such as liquidity provision and lending. These extra earnings come from the platform's revenue growth and broader ecosystem participation.

- **Increased Governance Power**

veHSK holders are granted additional voting rights in platform governance. Through veHSK, users can enjoy economic benefits while having a stronger voice in key decisions, such as platform development directions and parameter settings. This mechanism increases the platform's decentralization and ensures tighter alignment between user and platform interests.

- **Liquidity Incentives and Market Efficiency**
In future ecosystem designs, veHSK will play a critical role in liquidity pools. By integrating veHSK with DeFi protocols, users can earn fixed staking rewards, transaction fees, and liquidity incentives by contributing to market liquidity. This approach improves the efficiency of asset utilization and enhances ecosystem activity and diversity.

### A New Model for Flexibility and Returns

Compared to traditional staking methods, HashKey Chain's integration of veHSK with liquidity protocols brings users greater flexibility and earning potential. Users who generate veHSK by staking HSK can transfer it to the platform's liquidity pools, making it compatible with other DeFi protocols and injecting capital into the ecosystem. This solves the liquidity challenges of traditional staking and enables users to participate in a broader range of DeFi applications.

For example, under the veHSK system, holders can convert their staked veHSK into liquidity assets for participation in protocols. This allows veHSK holders to earn returns from liquidity activities such as trading and lending, maximizing their investment returns. Combining staking, liquidity, and governance creates multiple earning opportunities for users, resulting in a more sustainable and diversified economic model.

### Smart Contract Interoperability for Enhanced Efficiency

veHSK liquidity can also interact with other protocols via smart contracts, further improving users' capital efficiency. In this process, the platform provides veHSK holders with high-liquidity investment opportunities and enhances its market performance, increasing users' asset liquidity and participation in the market.

## Building a Thriving Developer Ecosystem

The success of any public blockchain ultimately depends on two key factors: its ecosystem and its users. However, the innovation and contributions of developers lay the foundation for ecosystem prosperity and user growth.

Recognizing this, HashKey Chain places developers at the core of its ecosystem development strategy. On the technical front, HashKey Chain leverages OP-Stack technology to provide developers with high-performance infrastructure and a comprehensive toolchain. This simplifies the deployment and building process, enabling rapid transformation from ideas to products.

To further support developers in building the HashKey ecosystem, HashKey Chain has launched generous grant incentives and ecosystem resource support. By tapping into the multi-channel resources, global investment network, and extensive blockchain project experience of HashKey Group and its partners, HashKey Chain offers early-stage support for developers and high-quality projects, enabling them to achieve cold starts.

### The $50 Million Atlas Grant Program

On December 11, 2024, HashKey Chain announced the $50 million Atlas Grant Program to identify and empower high-quality Web3 projects to drive exponential growth in applications and on-chain users within the HashKey Chain ecosystem. The program's first phase features a $10 million HSK token grant pool. Participating projects will receive non-dilutive funding, technical guidance, collaboration opportunities, and the chance to join events like hackathons.

- **Application Period:** The first phase of the Atlas Grant is open for applications from December 10, 2024, to January 10, 2025. The selected projects will be announced on January 20, 2025. So far, more than 100 projects have applied for the first phase.
- **Application Link:** https://github.com/orgs/HashkeyHSK/discussions/new?category=session-1

In 2025, HashKey Chain will continue to roll out the Atlas Grant in four additional phases — Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. Each phase will offer $10 million of HSK tokens to reward top developers. By growing alongside developers, HashKey Chain aims to foster a vibrant and open Web3 ecosystem, deliver groundbreaking applications with real user traffic across multiple blockchains, and achieve exponential growth in application layers and on-chain users.

### Developer Activity Series Inspired by Ancient Chinese Philosophy

Beyond its substantial grant incentives, HashKey Chain has launched a developer activity series inspired by ancient Chinese philosophy. Drawing on the five cosmic phases of creation — **Taichu (Primordial Beginning), Taiyi (Simple Oneness), Taishi (Great Initiation), Taisu (Simple Essence), and Taiji (Ultimate Harmony)** — this series is designed as a progressive innovation framework that supports developers throughout their journey from ideation to deployment.

This activity series includes three Hackerhouses and two Hackathons, offering developers unprecedented support in terms of technical assistance, ecosystem resources, and cultural inspiration.

- The first **HashKey Hacker House** was successfully held in Hong Kong on December 22, 2024. It attracted hundreds of outstanding developers and projects from around the world. This event showcased global developers' technical expertise and market insight and established HashKey Chain as a symbol of innovation and trust within the global developer community.

- In 2025, HashKey Chain will host four additional Hackathons/Hackerhouses in South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Thailand under the themes of "Taiyi," "Taishi," "Taisu," and "Taiji." Developers worldwide are welcome to compete for generous prizes and investment opportunities at these events.

## Continuing to Empower BTCFi, RWA, PayFi, and Stablecoins: Building the Bridge Between Web2 and Web3

HashKey Chain focuses on key tracks such as BTCFi, PayFi, RWA, and stablecoins to construct compliance-driven on-chain financial infrastructure. We aim to build a financial infrastructure that connects Web2 and Web3 and provide a full-stack Web3 solution.

### BTCFi (Bitcoin Financial Applications)

Over the past two years, the crypto industry has undergone transformative changes, especially in the Bitcoin ecosystem, which has evolved to exhibit entirely new characteristics. These include the emergence of BTC Layer 2 networks carrying Total Value Locked (TVL), on-chain BTC users seeking passive income, and traditional, compliant institutions buying Bitcoin in bulk following the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs. Together, these groups have driven the development of an ecosystem and supporting infrastructure.

The growing momentum of the Bitcoin ecosystem has accelerated the expansion of BTCFi. By the end of 2024, BTCFi's total market size had reached nearly $50 billion, with Bitcoin network TVL at $2 billion (including Layer 2 and sidechains), representing just 0.1% of Bitcoin's total market cap. In comparison, Ethereum's TVL accounts for 15.7% of its market cap, and Solana's stands at 5.6%. This indicates that BTCFi still has the potential for 10x growth.

In 2025, HashKey Chain will launch wrapped Bitcoin (HashKey BTC) assets on-chain. These assets will provide BTC holders with secure, stable, and attractive on-chain yields while unlocking the trillion-dollar market potential of BTCFi. HashKey BTC will leverage an over-collateralization mechanism to ensure network security and mitigate systemic risks.

Additionally, HBTC will offer staking returns above the market average. A bundled package of returns — comprising lending income, liquidity mining rewards, re-staking benefits, and HashKey platform reward points — will be provided to HBTC holders. HashKey Chain will actively screen high-quality projects to help users avoid risks and build a safe, open BTCFi ecosystem where BTC users and institutional investors can confidently engage with BTCFi financial derivatives.

### RWA (Real World Asset Tokenization)

According to The Defiant, the total market cap of RWAs reached a historic high of $14 billion in December 2024. Tokenized private credit and tokenized government bonds represent the largest segments of this market, accounting for $9.5 billion and $3 billion, respectively — together making up 89% of the on-chain RWA space. Since early 2024, the RWA market size has grown by 66%, reflecting significant interest from institutional investors.

The narrative of massive adoption drives the RWA market. Key growth factors include the tokenization trend in traditional financial assets and the demand from investors for greater liquidity and transparency.

As a global financial hub, Hong Kong offers an ideal environment for RWA tokenization. HashKey Chain seeks to bring high-quality financial products from traditional institutions into the blockchain world.

In December 2024, HashKey Group partnered with Cinda International Asset Management to launch the first STBL project issued by a Hong Kong financial institution. Hash Blockchain Limited ("HashKey Exchange") served as the initial distributor of STBL, a tokenized short-term asset-backed liquidity note issued by Cinda. In the future, Cinda plans to expand STBL issuance to HashKey Chain and introduce innovative incentive mechanisms to attract more investors.

STBL's underlying assets are AAA-rated Money Market Fund (MMF) portfolios. Each STBL token has a face value of $1, can be transferred 24/7, and automatically distributes daily accrued interest to professional investors' wallets as new tokens on monthly payout dates.

In 2025, HashKey Chain will support developers in tokenizing traditional assets like real estate, commodities, and art, enhancing asset liquidity and market transparency. This will inject new momentum into the real-world application of blockchain technology.

### PayFi (Payment Finance Solutions)

PayFi, short for Payment Finance, is a new paradigm combining payment and finance. Its core concept is "instant transactions," which enhances the efficiency of speculative trading and other financial operations.

Traditional payment systems rely on banks and third-party intermediaries, leading to high fees and slow transactions. PayFi eliminates these inefficiencies by enabling peer-to-peer payments via blockchain, reducing intermediary costs. Additionally, the automatic execution of smart contracts minimizes human intervention, ensuring secure, transparent, and error-free transactions.

HashKey Chain provides foundational technical support for developers to create secure and efficient payment solutions, driving the digital transformation of global payment systems.

### Stablecoins

Stablecoins serve as a critical medium connecting Web2 and Web3, with broad applications in real-world scenarios.

Hong Kong enforces strict regulatory requirements for fiat-backed stablecoin issuers, mandating full backing by high-quality, liquid reserve assets. Currently, only licensed issuers, recognized institutions, licensed corporations, and licensed virtual asset trading platforms can offer stablecoins. HashKey Exchange, as one of the first licensed platforms to serve retail users, has partnered with companies like Circle and AllinPay International to plan the issuance of Hong Kong dollar stablecoins. By 2025, more compliant regional stablecoins will be issued on HashKey Chain.

Through developing a robust stablecoin ecosystem, HashKey Chain will advance the real-world applications of blockchain technology in cross-border payments and decentralized finance, improving global transaction efficiency.

## Positioning HashKey Chain as a Leader in the Competitive Layer 2 Landscape

As one of more than 200 Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, HashKey Chain must forge its own unique path to stand out in the fiercely competitive landscape of 2025. Backed by HashKey Group, we hold a distinct advantage in compliance, global ecosystem resources, and bridging Web2 and Web3.

What sets HashKey Chain apart is that it was not created merely to launch another chain; it was born out of real-world demand. Our ultimate goal is to enable the large-scale adoption of Web3 in everyday life, empowering developers to create Web3 applications that serve billions of users, bringing Web2 assets into Web3, and creating a seamlessly connected world where Web2 and Web3 are fully integrated.
